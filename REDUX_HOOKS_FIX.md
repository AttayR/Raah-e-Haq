# 🔧 Redux Hooks Fix - COMPLETE

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED: useAppSelector Error Fixed!**

### 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The error was: `"useAppSelector is not a function (it is undefined)"`

This occurred because:

1. The `useAppSelector` hook was not properly exported from the Redux store
2. The ReduxProvider was not providing the typed hooks
3. Components were trying to import `useAppSelector` from ReduxProvider but it wasn't available

### 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Added Typed Hooks to Store** ✅

**File:** `src/store/index.ts`

- Added proper TypeScript typed hooks
- Exported `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`
- Used `TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState>` for proper typing

```typescript
// Typed hooks
import { useDispatch, useSelector, TypedUseSelectorHook } from 'react-redux';

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

#### **2. Updated ReduxProvider** ✅

**File:** `src/app/providers/ReduxProvider.tsx`

- Imported the typed hooks from store
- Exported them for use in components
- Maintained proper Redux setup

```typescript
import { store, persistor, useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../../store';

// Export the typed hooks
export { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector };
```
